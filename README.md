# React Weather Web App

This small project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Thanks to the openweather API(https://openweathermap.org/api) to let us access all the current weather data of cities in the whole world. 

The web's UI was crafted with Tailwind CSS(https://tailwindcss.com/).
